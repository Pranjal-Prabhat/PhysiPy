# Physics Library

Welcome to the Physics Library! This library provides easy access to various physics functions, organized into different categories for convenience.

# Usage

After downloading this repository open cmd as administator and run these to install PysiPy:-
```sh
cd %UserProfile%\Downloads
pip install PhysiPy-main.zip

Note:- This code only open cmd in downloads folder(default folder where files are downloaded using browser) and installs the library.
Note:- If this not work then either the library is not downloaded as zip in downloads folder or cmd has been not opened as administator

## Library Structure

The library is organized into the following modules:

### Linear

- **distance**: Calculate the distance traveled.
- **acceleration**: Calculate the acceleration.
- **collision_momentum**: Calculate the momentum during a collision.
- **time**: Calculate the time taken.

### Projectile

- **h_max**: Calculate the highest vertical height reached.
- **time_of_flight**: Calculate the total time the projectile will be in the air.
- **time_of_ascent**: Calculate the time taken to reach the peak.
- **time_of_descent**: Calculate the time taken to descend from the peak.
- **velocity_vertical**: Calculate the vertical velocity at a given time.
- **distance_covered_vertical**: Calculate the vertical distance covered at a given time.
- **distance_covered_horizontal**: Calculate the horizontal distance covered at a given time.
- **distance_covered_horizontal_max**: Calculate the maximum horizontal distance covered.

### Force

- **gravitational**: Calculate the gravitational force.
- **spring**: Calculate the force exerted by a spring.
- **buoyant**: Calculate the buoyant force.

### Energy

- **kinetic**: Calculate the kinetic energy.
- **potential**: Calculate the potential energy.
- **nuclear**: Calculate the nuclear energy.
